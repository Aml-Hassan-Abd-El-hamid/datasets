# Datasets

I built this repo to store my dataset, I first used to keep my dataset on Kaggle, but after a while, I found that holding my dataset on GitHub is better and that's due to the fact that it's much easier to modify and maintain datasets than it's on Kaggle, also it's much easier to use GitHub datasets on google colab.

Here's the datasets available on that repo and some info on them.

## Cat Dataset:

It contains 44 different cat breeds, the smallest class contains only 100 images and the largest class contains about 400 images.

I used this dataset in building my cat breed classifier website, I used 3 datasets to construct this dataset and Google images, and I used all the classes from the Gano Cat Breed Image Collection except for the "Tuxedo" which isn't technically a breed, that was 14 classes. I used the Scottish fold class from the Cat Breed dataset and the rest of the 29 classes came from the Cat Breeds Dataset (Cleared), those 29 classes contained a lot of bad images - misclassified and low quality - and I cleaned them as much as I could manually, also I collected more data for the Selkirk Rex, Korat, and Chartreux classes from Google images to make them at least 100 images.
