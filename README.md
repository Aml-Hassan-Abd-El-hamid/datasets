# Datasets

I built this repo to store my dataset, I first used to keep my dataset on Kaggle, but after a while, I found that holding my dataset on GitHub is better and that's due to the fact that it's much easier to modify and maintain datasets than it's on Kaggle, also it's much easier to use GitHub datasets on google colab.
